          <h2>Wireless Multimedia</h2>
          <p>Advances in information technologies have made it possible to have Personal Information Service, i.e., personalized multimedia information available anywhere, anytime.Such ubiquitous access requires that a portion of the underlying network infrastructure be wireless. Therefore, several challenges associated with operating a wireless. Multimedia network must be overcome. In this paper, we have identified these challenges and some solutions. </p>

              <h3>Introduction</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>With the affluence that comes with economic developments and technological advances, citizens around the world will demand personalized, on-demand, high quality information services, or Personal Information Service (PIS). </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
Such services are characterized by being personalized, i.e., tailored to the individual user, and ubiquitous, i.e., available anywhere, any time. For example, while in the past we are satisfied with broadcast TV, in which millions of people watch the same programs, now we want video on-demand (VoD), which allows one to choose the video at the desired time, and to interact with it.              </p>
			  <p>
Another example is Personal Communication Service (PCS). Each user is assigned a personal telecommunication number, and maybe reached anywhere in the world. In addition, each user will be able to access a variety of communication services on demand. The Internet provides yet another example of such personalized service, with each user customizing his access through a series of mouse clicks to get the information desired. Advances in computer, communication, consumer electronics, and information technologies in recent years have made such services available today to selected people.</p>
<p>
However, to make them available to the masses we must overcome several challenges. We must develop the infrastructure and protocols to support such services. This infrastructure will be a network of networks, including the existing public telecommunication networks, satellite networks, wireless networks, the Internet, etc. We must study each such network not only as an independent entity, but also as a collection.
</p>
<p>
The underlying protocol will most like be Internet Protocol (IP) based. In Section 2, we will describe some applications of wireless multimedia systems. Enabling technologies of such applications, and the challenges to be overcome before such systems will be widely deployed will be included in Section 3. We conclude in Section 4.

          <h2>Applications</h2>
          <p>Multimedia integration and real-time networking create a wide range of opportunities for multimedia applications. According to the different requirements imposed upon the information, communication, and computing subsystems, distributed multimedia applications may be broadly classified into three types:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6" data-aos="fade-right">
          </div>
     
              <h3>According to the different requirements imposed upon the information, communication, and computing subsystems, distributed multimedia applications may be broadly classified into three types: interactive video (ITV), tele cooperation, and hypermedia applications. </h3>
              <ul>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>ITV requires very high transmission rate and stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees. It is therefore difficult to provide such broadband services over existing low speed wireless networks. ITV typically demands point-to-point, switched connections. </li>
<br>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>Bandwidth requirement is asymmetric in that the bandwidth of the downstream channel which carries video programs from the server to the user is much higher than that of the upstream channel from the user to the server. </li>
<br>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>Tele-cooperation requires multicast, multipoint, and multiservice network support for group distribution. In contrast to the strict requirement on the video quality in ITV applications, tele-cooperation applications, such as videophone and desktop conferencing, allow lower picture quality, and therefore lower bandwidth requirements. It is possible to provide such services with the existing wireless networks. </li>
<br>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>Hypermedia applications, such as world wide web browsing, are retrieval services, and require point or multipoint to point and switched services. As with tele-cooperation applications, hypermedia applications require powerful multimedia database systems, with intuitive user interface such as visual query support, and content-based indexing and retrieval. Due to the huge volume of data transmitted, the existing wireless infrastructure can only support hypermedia applications in very limited forms. For example, while it is possible to surf the web with a notebook computer connected to a cellular system, the user will suffer excessive waiting while files are downloaded from the remote servers to the portable device through the slow wireless link. </li>
<br>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>The Wireless Multimedia Forum defined the following wireless multimedia service, namely, streaming multimedia (on-demand/live/scheduled), downloading multimedia, uploading multimedia, multimedia messaging (e.g., Video email), wireless video surveillance (e.g., wireless video camera), real-time multimedia communication (e.g., Videophone, videoconferencing), and interactive multimedia games. Again, each service will impose very different requirements on the underlying system infrastructure.</li>
<br>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>Perhaps the key application of wireless multimedia service will be M-commerce, which may be defined as the transacting of business on a non-proprietary wireless network, such as the existing cellular radio networks and 3G networks. We have chosen to exclude wireless systems that utilize a dedicated wireless network running proprietary protocols, because we believe that for m-commerce to flourish, the users must have ubiquitous access to this network infrastructure, and it will be difficult for a proprietary system to claim ubiquity. At the same time, our definition will include non-cellular wireless systems such as Wireless Local Area Networks, Bluetooth-based, and even satellite-based networks using non-proprietary protocols.</li>
<br>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>M-commerce may also be more generally defined as applications and services built on non-proprietary wireless network platforms. In this sense, the more narrowly de-fined m-commerce may be included as one of the applications, and other applications, such as remote monitoring and telemetry, information dissemination, etc., will also be included. In this paper, we will use the more general definition. No matter which definition you fancy, m-commerce is going to be huge. According to the Gartner Group, the global market for wireless data services will be over USD 50 billion by the year 2004, with 40% of the business-to-consumer e-commerce transactions outside North America conducted over a mobile phone. It is also estimated that there will be over one billion wireless subscribers worldwide by 2003 (source: Dataquest). One of the strongest growth regions is China, which has recently surpassed the US as the country with the largest number of mobile subscribers. The Asia Pacific region is expected to become the leading region for wireless data services by 2004. Of course, an explosive growth in cellular telephony may not necessarily translate to successful m-commerce.</li>
<br>
<p>We believe m-commerce will be successful because:</p>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>(1) It is a more cost-effective way to conduct business. It saves money by providing” just-in-time information delivery.” </li>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>(2) The” just-in-time” feature of mobile communications will introduce a variety of new services. </li>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>(3) The trend in the telecommunication world is towards” personalized” information service.</li>
<br>
<p>Enabling technologies and challenges the development of computing, networking, and consumer electronics technologies have made it possible to have wireless multimedia systems. In fact, today we can have limited forms of such service. </p>
<p>Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) connected to a cellular phone with a modem will allow us to send and receive email. There are also various forms of wireless data services available. Such services, however, are very limited in terms of data rates, and hence the form and variety of services available. A number of problems must be overcome before the large-scale deployment of wireless multimedia systems. </p>

          <h2>Watermarking and authentication</h2>
          <p>Wavelet-based reversible watermarking for authentication</p>
		  <p>Jun Tian</p>
		  <p>Security and watermarking of multimedia contents IV 4675, 679-690, 2002</p>
        </div>
<p>
In the digital information age, digital content (audio, image, and video) can be easily copied, manipulated, and distributed. Copyright protection and content authentication of digital content has become an urgent problem to content owners and distributors. Digital watermarking has provided a valuable solution to this problem.
</p>
<p>
Based on its application scenario, most digital watermarking methods can be divided into two categories: robust watermarking and fragile watermarking. 
</p>
<p>
As a special subset of fragile watermark, reversible watermark (which is also called lossless watermark, invertible watermark, erasable watermark) enables the recovery of the original, unwatermarked content after the watermarked content has been detected to be authentic. Such reversibility to get back unwatermarked content is highly desired in sensitive imagery, such as military data and medical data. In this paper we present a reversible watermarking method based on an integer wavelet transform. We investigate the binary representation of each wavelet coefficient and embed an extra bit to expandable wavelet coefficient. The location map of all expanded coefficients will be coded by JBIG2 compression and these coefficient values will be lossless compressed by arithmetic coding. Besides these two compressed bit streams, an SHA-256 hash of the original image will also be embedded for authentication purpose.
</p>
<p>
Watermarking and authentication of quantum images based on restricted geometric transformations.
</p>
<p>
A secure, keyless, and blind watermarking and authentication strategy for images on quantum computers, WA QI, is proposed based on restricted geometric transformations. In contrast with conventional digital watermarking techniques where geometric transformations on the contents of an image are considered undesirable, the proposed WA QI scheme utilizes the restricted variants (of the quantum versions) of these transformations as the main resources of the watermark embedding and authentication circuits. 
</p>
<p>
This is accomplished by a careful analysis of the classical content of the image–watermark pair, based on which a bespoke watermark map that translates into the gate sequences of the quantum watermark embedding and authentication circuits is realized. Simulation-based experimental results involving the classical (i.e. conventional or non-quantum) simulation of the input images, watermark signals, and quantum circuits yielded a 25% improvement in terms of overall watermark-embedding capacity and between 7% and 50.7% in terms of the visible quality of the watermarked images in comparison with select digital watermarking methods for various pairs, thus, demonstrating both the feasibility and capabilities of the proposed WA QI scheme when the necessary quantum hardware are realized physically. 
</p>
<p>
This scheme provides the framework for representing two or more quantum data as a single quantum circuit and opens the door for other applications aimed at quantum data protection.

          <h2>Multimedia Document</h2>
		  <p>What is Multimedia Document</p>
        </div>
<p>
1.They are digital documents displaying both verbal and pictorial information. Learn more in: Effects of Studying Tasks Compatibility with Tablets on Their Acceptance: How Experienced Tasks with Tablets Can Modify Perceptions of Tablets</p>
<p>
2.A multimedia document is a natural extension of a conventional textual document in the multimedia area. It is defined as a digital document that is composed of one or multiple media elements of different types (text, image, video, etc.) as a logically coherent unit. A multimedia document can be a single picture or a single MPEG video file, but more often it is a complicated document such as a Web page consisting of both text and images. Learn more in: Multimedia Information Retrieval at a Crossroad</p>
<p>
3.A document which contains more than one media. Whereas, in hard-copy documents only text, image and maps can be combined, electronic documents can contain any combination of multimedia data. </p>
<p>
The relationship of MIR with other document management systems
</p>
<p>
To conclude the discussion about MIR’s application techniques, two conditions must still be addressed. The first thing to make clear is the need for complex metadata, essential for the complete processing of multimedia documents, containing more, different types of data for the external and practical management of materials, in addition to containing the description of the resource, the contextual representation and the semantic interpretation. Of utmost importance here, is the cataloguing or archival data card belonging to the document, equipped with various items for sorting and integrating a document contained within the heritage of an institute, a company or a system of similar structures. Cards are equipped with the signatures of location needed for the physical retrieval of the original object, wherever it is.</p>
<p>
Data for a librarian’s or an archivist’s normal management of documents must necessarily integrate data designed for the specific documentation treatment, to allow the widest possible and practical availability of any type of material.</p>
<p>
From this comes the necessity of structuring a whole series of correlations of MIR with a library catalogue, or with an archive inventory, or with the single system or meta-system shared between them. These functional relations are essential to enable in libraries or multimedia libraries, together with the retrieval of the original document conserved by them, effective integration into the whole, with the other information resources that are untreated by the MIR system. An archive inventory must not only allow the physical retrieval of documents and the sorting and integration of documents alongside those not considered in a multimedia search system but must also indicate and manage the special bond that binds a given document to others, according to the natural formative process of the fundaments of the archive itself.
</p>
<p>
Even in these cases, thought must go into the different correlations MIR has with any internal or external context, in accordance with an organic perspective. This attribute is now simply the need for an overall organization of the whole system, library, archive, or systems of some of them. The methods and techniques of MIR, therefore, must be incorporated and welded to methods and techniques of processing, sorting, location, and retrieval of other genres, that will invest all the documents and materials managed into a developed and complete information system. In this way it is possible to go ahead with an organization where the various methodologies constituting it can be designed, defined, and applied in a unique and complex whole, making the activity of the organism all the more useful.
</p>
<p>
Each multimedia document must be equipped with different types of metadata. In addition to the presence of ‘descriptive’ metadata, which is essential for all search and retrieval operations, a document must also possess the various metadata crucial to its management in the ensemble of any structure, as in MIR systems themselves.
