                <li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>1. Modern digital television is transmitted in high definition (HDTV) with greater resolution than analog TV. It typically uses a widescreen aspect ratio (commonly 16:9) in contrast to the narrower format of analog TV. It makes more economical use of scarce radio spectrum space; it can transmit up to seven channels in the same bandwidth as a single analog channel</li>
                <li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>2. and provides many new features that analog television cannot. A transition from analog to digital broadcasting began around 2000. Different digital television broadcasting standards have been adopted in different parts of the world; below are the more widely used standards:</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) uses coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation and supports hierarchical transmission. This standard has been adopted in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, for a total of approximately 60 countries.
              </p>
			  <p>
Advanced Television System Committee (ATSC) uses eight-level vestigial sideband (8VSB) for terrestrial broadcasting. This standard has been adopted by 6 countries: the United States, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, the Dominican Republic and Honduras.
</p>
<p>
Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting (ISDB) is a system designed to provide good reception to fixed receivers and also portable or mobile receivers. It utilizes OFDM and two-dimensional interleaving. It supports hierarchical transmission of up to three layers and uses MPEG-2 video and Advanced Audio Coding. This standard has been adopted in Japan and the Philippines. ISDB-T International is an adaptation of this standard using H.264/MPEG-4 AVC, which has been adopted in most of South America and Portuguese-speaking African countries.
</p>
<p>
Digital Terrestrial Multimedia Broadcasting (DTMB) adopts time-domain synchronous (TDS) OFDM technology with a pseudo-random signal frame to serve as the guard interval (GI) of the OFDM block and the training symbol. The DTMB standard has been adopted in the People's Republic of China, including Hong Kong and Macau.[3]
</p>
<p>
Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) is a digital radio transmission technology developed in South Korea[4][5][6] as part of the national IT project for sending multimedia such as TV, radio and datacasting to mobile devices such as mobile phones, laptops and GPS navigation systems.

              <ul>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>Ingest engines bring information into Media Server for processing. Images might be decoded or extracted from documents; video must be demuxed and decoded into audio, video, and metadata.</li>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>Analysis engines run analysis on ingested media to extract information about its content. Each engine performs a different type of analysis.</li>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>Event stream processing engines can be used to introduce additional custom logic into analysis. For example, you can filter or deduplicate the information produced during analysis. Event stream processing can change the schema of the data.</li>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>Transform engines transform data. For example, you can change the size of video frames before sending them to the image encoder.</li>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>Encoding engines write a copy of ingested video to disk, or encode it into different formats. Some encoding engines, such as the MPEG encoder, can produce a live UDP stream that you can view in a media player.</li>
<li><i class="bx bx-check-double"></i>Output engines convert the metadata produced by Media Server into different formats and send it to other systems such as IDOL Server or a Vertica database.</li>

          <h2>Audio and video streaming over the internet</h2>
          <p>How Streaming Video and Audio Work</p>
		  <p>BY TRACY V. WILSON</p>
		  <p>In the early days of streaming media -- the mid-to-late 1990s -- watching videos and listening to music online wasn't always fun. It was a little like driving in stop-and-go traffic during a heavy rain. If you had a slow computer or a dial-up Internet connection, you could spend more time staring at the word "buffering" on a status bar than watching videos or lisÂ­tening to songs. On top of that, everything was choppy, pixilated and hard to see.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-lg-6 order-2 order-lg-1">
            <div class="icon-box mt-5 mt-lg-0" data-aos="fade-up">
              <i class="bx bx-receipt"></i>
              <h4>Streaming video and audio </h4>
              <p>Streaming video and audio have come a long way since then. According to Bridge Ratings, 57 million people listen to Internet radio every week. In 2006, people watched more than a million streaming videos a day on YouTube [source: Reuters]. The same year, television network ABC started streaming its most popular TV shows over the Web. People who missed an episode of shows like "Lost" or "Grey's Anatomy" could catch up on the entire thing online -- legally and for free.</p>

              <h4>The success of streaming media </h4>
              <p>The success of streaming media is pretty recent, but the idea behind it has been around as long as people have. When someone talks to you, information travels toward you in the form of a sound wave. Your ears and brain decode this information, allowing you to understand it. This is also what happens when you watch TV or listen to the radio. Information travels to an electronic device in the form of a cable signal, a satellite signal or radio waves. The device decodes and displays the signal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="icon-box mt-5" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="200">
              <i class="bx bx-images"></i>
              <h4>Decoder</h4>
              <p>In streaming video and audio, the traveling information is a stream of data from a server. The decoder is a stand-alone player or a plugin that works as part of a Web browser. The server, information stream and decoder work together to let people watch live or prerecorded broadcasts.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="icon-box mt-5" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-delay="300">
              <i class="bx bx-shield"></i>
              <h4>Article</h4>
              <p>In this article, we'll explore what it takes to create this stream of ones and zeros as well as how it differs from the data in a typical download. We'll also take a look at how to make good streaming media </p>

              <h4>Sound and Video</h4>
			  <p>If you have a connection to the Internet and you want to find streaming video and audio files, you shouldn't have to look far. Sound and video have become a common part of sites all over the Web, and the process of using these files is pretty intuitive. You find something you want to watch or hear -- you click it, and it plays. Unless you're watching a live feed or a webcast, you can often pause, back up and move forward through the file, just like you could if you were watching a DVD or listening to a CD.</p>            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="image col-lg-6 order-1 order-lg-2" style='background-image: url("assets/img/index.jpg");' data-aos="fade-left" data-aos-delay="100"></div>
        
		</div>
<p>
But if you've never used streaming media, your computer may need a little help to decode and play the file. You'll need a plugin for your Web browser or a stand-alone player. Most of the time, the Web page you've visited points you in the right direction. It prompts you to download a specific player or shows you a list of choices.
